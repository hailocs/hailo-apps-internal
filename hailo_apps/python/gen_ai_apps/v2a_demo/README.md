Hailo Voice-to-Action Demo
==========================

A voice-controlled AI assistant powered by a Hailo-10H AI accelerator. Speak a command, and the system will identify the right tool, extract parameters, execute it, and speak the results back — all using on-device AI inference.

Requirements
------------
- Hailo-10H host device
- Microphone and speaker
- Python 3.10+
- HailoRT Python package (`hailo-platform`) installed per [Hailo documentation](https://hailo.ai/developer-zone/)
- Dependencies from `requirements.txt`

Supported Models
----------------

This example uses the following models:

- Wake Word Detection: OpenWakeWord (ONNX, CPU)
- Stage 1 — STT: Whisper-Base (HEF, Hailo)
- Stage 2 — Tool Selection: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (HEF, Hailo)
- Stage 3 — LLM: Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct (HEF, Hailo)
- Stage 5 — TTS: Piper TTS (ONNX, CPU)

HEF resources are resolved via the shared resources catalog and auto-downloaded on first run (same flow as standalone apps).

## Linux Installation

This app supports standalone installation only.

### Standalone Installation

Adding a New Tool
-----------------

Adding a tool requires one new file and one line in the registry.

**Step 1.** Create `tools/your_tool.py`:

```python
"""Description of your tool."""

TOOL_PROMPT = (
    "Extract parameters from the user's request as a JSON object.\n"
    "Parameters:\n"
    '- "param1" (required): Description.\n'
    "\n"
    "Examples:\n"
    '"Do something with X" -> {"param1": "X"}\n'
    "\n"
    "Output ONLY the JSON object, nothing else."
)

# Natural language descriptions of what this tool does.
# The tool selector compares the user's speech against these to decide
# which tool to invoke. Write 7-10 diverse phrasings of the same intent.
TOOL_DESCRIPTIONS = [
    "Do something with a given input",
    "Perform an action on X",
    "Can you do something for me?",
    "I want to do something with X",
    "Handle requests to do something",
    "Process a user's request to do X",
    "Execute an action based on user input",
]

def your_tool(param1: str) -> str:
    """Execute the tool. Parameter names must match the JSON keys in TOOL_PROMPT.
    Returns a string that will be spoken back to the user."""
    return f"Done with {param1}."
```

**Step 2.** Register in `tools/__init__.py` — add the import and one line to `_REGISTRY`:

```python
from tools import ..., your_tool

_REGISTRY = {
    ...
    "your_tool": (your_tool, "your_tool"),
}
```

For tools that take no parameters (like `system_check`), set `TOOL_PROMPT` to output `{}` and add the tool name to `NO_PARAM_TOOLS` in `tools/__init__.py`.

Additional Notes
----------------

- This demo targets Hailo-10H systems.
- `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` is required only for weather requests.
- If `--audio-input-path` is not provided, the app runs in continuous listening mode.
