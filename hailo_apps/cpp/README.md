# Hailo C++ Applications

> **Beta:** These applications are actively developed. APIs and features may change between releases.

A collection of standalone C++ inference applications for Hailo AI accelerators. Each application runs inference directly using the HailoRT C++ API — no GStreamer required — and supports image, video file, and live camera inputs out of the box.

## Prerequisites

### Linux

| Dependency | Minimum Version | Install |
|---|---|---|
| HailoRT | 4.23.0 (Hailo-8/8L) / 5.1.0 (Hailo-10H) | [Hailo Developer Zone](https://hailo.ai/developer-zone/) |
| CMake | 3.20 | `pip install cmake` |
| OpenCV | 4.5.4 | `sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev` |
| GCC / G++ | 9+ | `sudo apt-get install build-essential` |
| Git | any | `sudo apt-get install git` |

yaml-cpp and libcurl are bundled as submodules and built automatically — no manual installation needed.

### Windows

| Dependency | Minimum Version | Install |
|---|---|---|
| HailoRT | 4.23.0 (Hailo-8/8L) / 5.1.0 (Hailo-10H) | [Hailo Developer Zone](https://hailo.ai/developer-zone/) |
| CMake | 3.20 | [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download/) |
| OpenCV | 4.5.4 | `vcpkg install opencv` |
| Visual Studio | 2019+ | With "Desktop development with C++" workload |
| Git for Windows | any | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) — required by `build.ps1` for Unix tools (`sed`) |

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone with `--recurse-submodules` to pull in the bundled third-party libraries (yaml-cpp, curl) that are required for the build:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-apps.git
cd hailo-apps
```

If you already cloned without submodules, initialize them now:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

> **Why submodules?** yaml-cpp and libcurl are included as Git submodules under `hailo_apps/cpp/external/`. The build system uses them automatically if system packages are not available, so the build works identically on all supported platforms without additional setup.

### 2. Navigate to the C++ Applications Directory

```bash
cd hailo_apps/cpp
```

---

## Building the Applications

All applications are built through a single build script: **`build.sh`** on Linux and **`build.ps1`** on Windows. Both scripts share the same interface and behavior:

1. Check whether yaml-cpp and libcurl are available as system packages.
2. If not, build them **once** from the bundled submodules into a shared `deps/` directory.
3. Build whichever applications you specify (or all of them).
4. Print a pass/fail summary at the end.

Shared dependencies are built only once and reused across all applications — subsequent builds are fast.

Use `build.sh` on Linux and `build.ps1` on Windows — the interface is identical.

#### Build All Applications

```bash
./build.sh
```

#### Build Specific Applications

```bash
./build.sh object_detection
./build.sh object_detection instance_segmentation pose_estimation
```

#### Clean Build (Remove Previous Build Artifacts)

Use `--rebuild` to delete each application's `build/` directory before rebuilding. Useful when switching branches or after changing CMake options:

```bash
./build.sh --rebuild
./build.sh --rebuild object_detection
```

#### Help

```bash
./build.sh --help
```

#### Build Output

Each application binary is placed in its own `build/` directory:

```
hailo_apps/cpp/
├── object_detection/build/object_detection
├── instance_segmentation/build/instance_segmentation
├── classification/build/classification
└── ...
```

A `config/` folder is copied next to each binary at build time, containing the YAML configuration files the application needs at runtime:

```
object_detection/build/
├── object_detection          ← executable
└── config/
    ├── resources_config.yaml
    └── visualization_config.yaml
```

#### Build Summary

At the end of each build, a summary shows which applications succeeded and which failed:

```
==========================================
 Build Summary
==========================================
  ✓  classification
  ✓  object_detection
  ✓  instance_segmentation
  ✗  onnxrt_hailo_pipeline
==========================================
```

## Running an Application

Each application has its own arguments and usage. Refer to the individual README linked in the [Application Reference](#application-reference) table for full details.

To quickly see what a binary accepts, run it with `--help`:

```bash
./build/object_detection --help
./build/classification --help
```

## Input Sources

| Input | Argument | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Image file | `--input bus.jpg` | JPEG, PNG, BMP supported |
| Video file | `--input video.mp4` | Any format OpenCV can decode |
| Directory | `--input images/` | Processes all images in the directory |
| USB camera | `--input usb` | Auto-selects first USB camera |
| Specific camera | `--input /dev/video2` | Linux only |
| Raspberry Pi camera | `--input rpi` | Raspberry Pi only |
| CSI camera | `--input csi` | Yocto-based systems (e.g. Astrial/IMX8). ISP must be initialized first — see [Platform Notes](#platform-notes) |
| Camera index | `--input 1` | Windows camera index |
| Predefined resource | `--input bus` | Auto-downloaded from `resources_config.yaml` |

---

## Visualization Configuration

`object_detection` and `instance_segmentation` support a `config/visualization_config.yaml` file (copied next to the executable at build time) that controls how detections are rendered:

```yaml
visualization_params:
  score_thres: 0.42        # Minimum confidence to display a detection
  max_boxes_to_draw: 30    # Maximum detections drawn per frame
```


---

## Using Multiple Models on the Same Device

To run multiple models on the same Hailo device simultaneously, assign them the same `group_id`:

```cpp
std::string group_id = "my_group";
AsyncModelInfer model1("detector.hef", group_id);
AsyncModelInfer model2("classifier.hef", group_id);
```

Models in the same group share the device's virtual device context, improving resource utilization when running inference pipelines that involve more than one network.

## Platform Notes

### Astrial / NXP i.MX8MP

- **Video input format:** Input video files must be H.264-encoded with **YUV 4:2:0** chroma subsampling. The hardware video decoder (`v4l2h264dec`) on the i.MX8MP VPU only accepts this format. Videos encoded with 4:4:4 subsampling or other codecs will not decode correctly with hardware acceleration.

  To re-encode a video to the correct format:
  ```bash
  ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -profile:v baseline output.mp4
  ```

- **Video saving (`-s`):** When saving a processed video stream (`-s`/`--save-stream-output`), FPS may drop when decoding from a video file due to VPU contention between the hardware decoder and encoder. This does not affect camera input.

- **CSI camera (`--input csi`):** The Astrial exposes its CSI camera as a standard V4L2 device after the ISP is initialized. Before using `--input csi`, start the ISP on the device:

  ```bash
  cd /opt/imx8-isp/bin && ./run.sh -lm -c dual_imx219_1080p60 &
  ```

  The application will then auto-detect the first non-USB V4L2 capture device. If no device is found, a warning is printed with this command as a reminder. `--input csi` is only accepted on Yocto-based systems — it will error immediately on Windows or standard desktop Linux.

---

## Camera Tips

- On some systems, OpenCV may default to GStreamer for camera capture and print warnings. Force V4L2 instead:
  ```bash
  export OPENCV_VIDEOIO_PRIORITY_GSTREAMER=0
  export OPENCV_VIDEOIO_PRIORITY_V4L2=100
  ```

- If the camera returns a permission error:
  ```bash
  sudo chmod 777 /dev/video0
  ```

- Press **Q** in any display window to exit cleanly.
