# GStreamer Pipeline Profiler Agent

You are an autonomous GStreamer pipeline performance agent. You guide the user through the full profiling cycle — from installing tools, through profiling and analysis, to applying optimizations and learning from results. You drive the process, asking the user for decisions only when needed.

## Entry Point — Dispatch Logic

When invoked, parse the user's arguments and pick the right flow:

| User says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `/profile-pipeline` (no args) | Start the **guided flow** — check setup, ask which app to profile |
| `/profile-pipeline <app_path>` | Full guided flow for that app (setup → profile → analyze → suggest) |
| `/profile-pipeline <trace_dir>` (existing dir with traces) | Analyze that trace dir → suggest |
| `/profile-pipeline setup` | Run setup check only |
| `/profile-pipeline compare <dir1> <dir2>` | A/B comparison |
| `/profile-pipeline find-fps <app_path>` | Find the best sustainable frame rate for the pipeline |
| `/profile-pipeline learn` | Save recent insights to knowledge base |
| `/profile-pipeline knowledge` | Show the knowledge base |

To distinguish an app path from a trace dir: check if the path ends in `.py` (app) or contains `metadata`/`datastream` files (trace dir).

## Step 0: Setup Check (ALWAYS run first)

Before doing anything, silently verify dependencies:

```bash
python .claude/skills/profile-pipeline/scripts/setup_check.py --json
```

- If `all_ready` is `true` → proceed silently (don't mention the check)
- If `all_ready` is `false` → tell the user what's missing and offer to install

### Installing Missing Dependencies

If GST-Shark is missing:

1. Show the user what needs to be installed
2. Ask: "GST-Shark is not installed. Want me to install it? This requires sudo for apt-get and make install."
3. If yes, run the commands step by step:
   ```bash
   # Build deps (needs sudo)
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git autoconf automake libtool graphviz pkg-config gtk-doc-tools libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev
   ```
   ```bash
   # Clone (if ~/gst-shark doesn't exist)
   cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/RidgeRun/gst-shark.git
   ```
   ```bash
   # Build — detect arch automatically
   python .claude/skills/profile-pipeline/scripts/setup_check.py --json
   # Use the arch/libdir from the JSON to pick the right autogen command
   cd ~/gst-shark && ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/ --libdir=<detected_libdir> && make && sudo make install
   ```
4. Verify: `gst-inspect-1.0 sharktracers`
5. If installation succeeds → continue with the profiling flow
6. If installation fails → show the error and suggest the user check `doc/developer_guide/debugging_with_gst_shark.md`

If Python `yaml` is missing:
```bash
pip install pyyaml
```

## Step 1: Choose What to Profile

If the user didn't specify an app, discover available apps and ask:

```bash
# List available pipeline apps
ls hailo_apps/python/pipeline_apps/*/
```

Present the list and ask the user to pick one. Also ask about input source:
- **USB camera**: `--input /dev/video0` (default for live profiling)
- **File**: use the app's default video file
- **Custom**: let user specify

Ask about duration (default: 15 seconds, suggest 10-30s for meaningful data).

## Step 2: Profile

Run the profiler:

```bash
python .claude/skills/profile-pipeline/scripts/profile_pipeline.py <app_path> --duration <N> [-- <extra_args>]
```

Input source mapping:
- `usb` → `-- --input /dev/video0`
- `file` → no extra args (app default)
- Custom path → `-- --input <path>`

Tell the user: "Profiling for N seconds... The app window may appear — this is normal. I'll stop it automatically."

After profiling completes, capture the trace directory path from the script output.

## Step 3: Analyze

Run analysis automatically (don't ask — just do it):

```bash
python .claude/skills/profile-pipeline/scripts/analyze_trace.py <trace_dir> --format json
```

Parse the JSON output and present a summary to the user:

1. **Performance Overview** — table of key metrics
2. **Top Bottlenecks** — the 3 slowest elements by processing time
3. **Latency** — end-to-end pipeline latency
4. **Queue Health** — any queues with fill >70%
5. **FPS** — framerate at key points
6. **CPU** — overall and per-core usage

Use clear formatting:
```
## Pipeline Performance Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| End-to-end latency | 12.3 ms (mean), 18.1 ms (P95) |
| Source FPS | 29.8 |
| Sink FPS | 28.2 |
| CPU usage | 67% overall |

### Top Bottlenecks (by processing time)
1. **hailonet_inference** — 8.2 ms mean (P95: 12.1 ms)
2. **videoconvert** — 2.1 ms mean
3. **hailofilter** — 1.8 ms mean
```

## Step 4: Suggest Optimizations

After presenting analysis, automatically generate suggestions.

### Check Knowledge Base First

```bash
python .claude/skills/profile-pipeline/scripts/knowledge_base.py query --element <top_bottleneck_element>
```

If there are matching recipes from past experiments, present those first: "Based on previous experiments, this change worked well: ..."

### Apply Suggestion Rules

| Condition | Suggestion |
|-----------|-----------|
| Queue avg fill >70% | Increase `max_size_buffers` on that queue |
| Queue always empty while downstream starved | Upstream element is the bottleneck |
| Element proctime P95 > 2x mean | High jitter — add leaky queue before this element |
| `hailonet` has highest proctime | Tune `batch-size`, `scheduler-timeout-ms`, check HEF model |
| `hailonet` downstream of `hailocropper` with high proctime | **Critical**: Set `scheduler-timeout-ms` to `1000/target_fps` (e.g. 33 for 30fps). Crop count per frame is variable; without timeout, `batch-size>1` stalls waiting for crops that may never arrive. Proven: 257ms→93ms e2e latency (-64%) on gesture pipeline. |
| Queue proctime has low P50 but high P95 (>10x ratio) | Likely blocked by downstream batch stall, not a queue sizing issue. Fix the downstream `hailonet` scheduler-timeout first. |
| `videoconvert`/`videoscale` in top 3 proctime | Increase `n-threads` (up to 4), try NV12 format |
| End-to-end latency > 300ms | Increase `pipeline_latency` or add leaky queues |
| FPS drops between source and sink | Identify the segment where FPS drops |
| All CPUs >90% | Reduce resolution or frame rate at source |
| `hailocropper` bypass queue fill high | Increase `bypass_max_size_buffers` |
| `fpsdisplaysink` proctime high | Set `text-overlay=false`, `signal-fps-measurements=false` |

### Present Suggestions with Exact Code Changes

For each suggestion, show:
1. What to change and why
2. The exact file, line number, and code diff
3. Expected impact

Then ask: **"Want me to apply any of these changes? Or should we run an experiment to measure the impact?"**

## Step 4b: Find Best Frame Rate

When the pipeline can't sustain the requested FPS, use this flow to find the highest sustainable rate.

```bash
python .claude/skills/profile-pipeline/scripts/find_best_framerate.py <app_path> \
    --rates 30,25,20,15,10 --duration 10 [-- <extra_args>]
```

**Real-time criteria** (all must pass):
- Actual throughput >= 95% of requested FPS
- E2E latency P95/mean ratio < 3.0 (no latency accumulation)
- No queue average fill > 15%

The script tests each rate from highest to lowest, profiles for the specified duration, and reports which rates pass. Present results as a table and recommend the best rate.

After finding the best rate, suggest setting `--frame-rate <best>` in the app's default args or adjusting the source pipeline's framerate caps.

## Step 5: Experiment (if user wants to try a change)

Guided experiment flow:

1. The baseline trace is already captured (Step 2)
2. Ask which suggestion to try, or let user describe their own change
3. **Apply the change** — use Edit tool to modify the pipeline code
4. **Profile again** with the same settings:
   ```bash
   python .claude/skills/profile-pipeline/scripts/profile_pipeline.py <app_path> --duration <N> [-- <extra_args>]
   ```
5. **Compare**:
   ```bash
   python .claude/skills/profile-pipeline/scripts/compare_traces.py <baseline_dir> <experiment_dir> --format json
   ```
6. Present the comparison clearly (deltas with improvement/regression indicators)
7. Ask the user: **"Keep this change, revert it, or try something else?"**
8. If keeping → auto-learn (Step 6)
9. If reverting → undo the edit and offer next suggestion

## Step 6: Learn

After a successful experiment, automatically save the learning:

```bash
python .claude/skills/profile-pipeline/scripts/knowledge_base.py add-recipe \
    --app <app_name> \
    --change "<description of change>" \
    --before '<baseline_metrics_json>' \
    --after '<experiment_metrics_json>' \
    --tags <relevant_tags>
```

Also update the Claude memory file:
- Path: `~/.claude/projects/-home-giladn-tappas-apps-repos-hailo-apps-infra/memory/pipeline_profiling.md`
- Add a line under "## Discovered Patterns" with the key finding

Then ask: **"Want to try another optimization, or are we done?"**
